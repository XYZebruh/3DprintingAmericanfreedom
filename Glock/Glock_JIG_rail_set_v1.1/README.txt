The Freeman's G17 front rail block DIY Jigs

These jigs will aid people who aren't mechanically inclined in fabbing the rail blocks on their own.

The first 3 jigs are for facing off - jigs 4 and 5 are for profiling.



I'll upload a video showing how you use each jig, and how to use calipers (because you do still need a way to measure what you do).

The PLA jigs shown in the video were created with the following basic slicer settings:
	.3mm layers
	100% infill
	230C for the nozzle
	65C for the bed

If the jigs are not scaled correctly in your slicer, try scaling up by 1000% (10x), or by 2540% (25.4x) to account for nonconforming units.


==================
==v1.1 Changelog==
